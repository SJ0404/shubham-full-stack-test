# Answers to Technical Questions

### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
I spent approximately 2-3 hours on the coding test. If I had more time, I would focus on the following enhancements:
- **Refactor Code:** Improve code modularity and readability, ensuring clean architecture with proper separation of concerns.
- **Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error handling and edge-case coverage to ensure robustness.
- **Performance Optimization:** Fine-tune any performance bottlenecks that could arise when handling larger datasets or more complex computations.
- **Unit Tests:** Increase test coverage with more unit tests to validate edge cases and scenarios.
- **Documentation:** Add detailed comments and documentation to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

### 2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Yes, I have had to track down performance issues in production. My approach typically involves the following steps:
- **Monitor Logs:** I would first analyze logs (using tools like ELK stack, Graylog, or Splunk) to identify unusual patterns or slow queries.
- **Profiling:** Use profiling tools such as New Relic, Blackfire, or Xdebug to pinpoint the slow sections of code, database queries, or API calls.
- **Database Optimization:** I would check database queries for inefficiencies such as missing indexes, slow joins, or large datasets causing delays.
- **Caching:** Review and optimize the use of caching layers (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce unnecessary processing.
- **Load Testing:** Use load testing tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to simulate high traffic and observe where the bottlenecks appear.
- **Code Review:** Conduct code reviews to check for inefficient algorithms or resource-heavy operations.
